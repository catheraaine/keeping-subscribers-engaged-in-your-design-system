# Keeping Subscribers Engaged in Your Design System
A talk based on Catherine's *Foundry* article, [*Keeping Subscribers Engaged in Your Design System*](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/keeping_subscribers_engaged_in_your_design_system).

### Getting started
- To install Node modules run `npm install`.
- To generate and serve the slide deck run `npm start`.
- The page will be served at port `:3000` by default.
- Note: This version of `node-sass` doesn't play nicely with Node `v10`. Node `v8` works fine.
