Notes:* I wanted to start today by telling you the story of Vincent Van Gogh. Van Gogh is a famous Dutch painter, some people even say the best of all time, next to Rembrandt. 
* During his most prolific decade, Van Gogh painted almost 900 works, icluding landscapes, self-portraits, sunflowers, and more.
* His &quot;Starry Night&quot; painting is available as phone cases, cross-stitch patterns, and cosmetic items in video games like &quot;Apex Legends.&quot; There are movies, books, and tv shows about him, including my all time favorite episode of &quot;Doctor Who.&quot;

Notes:* Van Gogh&#x27;s life, however, was a terribly sad story with a tragic ending. While alive, he sold only a single painting, and that was to a family member. 
* Lots of jobs, like me
* Maybe cut off his own ear. Maybe Paul Gauguin did it.
How is it posisble that one man with such a brilliant body of work was unable to make a living doing it?
*  Like Van Gogh&#x27;s works, many design systems are objectively well-made, useful, and even beautiful. Also like Van Gogh&#x27;s works, design systems can be hard to get people to buy into. 
* So how do we as content creators do what Van Gogh couldn&#x27;t, and get people to buy our paintings, er, design system?

Notes:* According to the 99 designs blog, &quot;A brand style guide is a document that codifies how an organization presents itself to the world. Put another way, it’s a reference tool that helps maintain consistency by demonstrating what a brand looks, feels and sounds like.&quot;

Notes:* In 2018, Sparkbox put together a design systems survey in order to chip away at the ambiguity around one of our core technologies.

Notes:* A design system can be a architeture device that provides both brand expression and completed components,
* It can be a &#x27;pattern library&#x27; as a place to copy-and-paste common code snippets, 
* It can be a style guide, providing color palette, fonts, iconography, and animations, as well as tone and voice guidelines and so much more.
* Whatever a design system means to you and your team, eventually we all ask the question, “How do we encourage people to keep using our design system?”

Notes:* Beyond &quot;design system&quot;, I say the word &quot;subscriber&quot; quite a bit. 
* In this case, a &quot;subscriber&quot; is someone who will implement the design system on a larger body of work.
* A subscriber can be a developer, designer, copy-writer, or product manager or owner.
* These sub-groups have different needs, and it may be worthwhile to identify which groups have a vested interest in each specific area of your system.

* Even if you aren&#x27;t working on a design system, I hope you find worth in some of the things I&#x27;m going to talk about.
* The design system I&#x27;ve been working on for nearly three years is not new. It was first thought of in 2015, and released to beta in early 2016. 
* We&#x27;ve gone through five major versions, that&#x27;s five releases of exciting new components and messy breaking changes. We&#x27;ve had huge successes, such as changing every instance of a major brand color and or the entire font profile of multiple brands almost at the flip of a switch.
* We&#x27;ve had huge failures, components that go unused or outdated, JavaScript that does nothing but sit in a repository, and a number of late night patch releases. 
* And still I end up asking myself this question on a regular basis.

[designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/)
Notes:* The Sparkbox design systems survey asked the question, why do you think your design system failed? 
* There were a lot of answers, from lack of executive champion to funding issues. In my mind, all of these answers boil down to one thing. 
* These failing systems were not considered products.

## Your Design System <br /> = Your Product.
Notes:* In order to convince subscribers to use your design system, you must treat it like a product.

## Hold Stakeholder Interviews
Notes:* Decide if a story will effect stakeholders in a meaningful way. If yes, schedule what we call a &quot;stakeholder interview.&quot; Who has a stake in the way this story plays out?
* Assign one person to run the interview. Often, this will include a demo and questions in advance. The rest of the contributing team should attend, but their goal is to observe, learn, and ask questions, not to have discussion or try to persuade the interviewee. 
* Spend as much time as possible on the stakeholders&#x27; thoughts, your time with them is limited.
* Ultimately your design system team will make a decision on its own, but this decision should be informed by the information gathered in the stakeholder interviews. The decision may simply be a confirmation of your path forward.

Notes:* Alternatively, I want to point out Hubspot&#x27;s rotating design system team.
* In this blog post, Hubspot explains that their process for creating a design system team is to dedicate hours from product team members on a rotating, 6-month schedule. 
* The idea is that if the design system is owned by all, everyone has the opportunity to create something they&#x27;ll want to use.
* There is a ton of context that comes from rotating onto a team while spending time as a subscriber; team members have an intimate understanding of subscriber problems.
* If your organization can accomplish this, or something like it, I think that is a brilliant option.

Notes:* Finding the budget to support even a part-time team of designers, developers, and project managers on your “idea” of a system may seem difficult or even impossible at first. 
* Look for funding in interesting places. 
* UX and design have a potential vested interest, as design systems often create consistency throughout branded experiences. 
* If your team has an R&amp;D budget, that can be a great place to create “startup” or &quot;skunkworks&quot; kinds of projects. 
* If your team works under one of the many models that makes time for tech debt, perhaps your design system can be built alongside refactoring of duplicate components.

Notes:* If there is truly no funding to be had, attempt to find people who have a personal stake in the success of a system to work on a proof of concept. However, as soon as you have a proof of concept, look for funding again.

## SemVer for the Win!

[semver.org](https://semver.org/)
Notes:* Develop a plan for semantic versioning, whether it be SemVer or something unique to your team. 
* Then, version components consistently so subscribers understand exactly what a version update means.
* Document it well.

## Name things.

`(.ellipses != .ellipsis)` <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
Notes:* Everything from component class names to color variables should be named in a thoughtful way.
* Deprecating mistakes in naming can make a system clunky, annoying, or even unusable. 
* Some mishaps are minor, but reduce credibility of your whole system. 
* I like to use BEM naming conventions, because people smarter than me have written the documentation, but whatever works for your team is fine.
* The one thing I wished I had done and will do forever in the future is develop a design system namespace from day one.
* Document it well.

## Build a documentation site.
Notes:* Design system teams are often small, and a good documentation website (affectionately called a “docs site”) often helps users solve their own problems without direct intervention from your team. 
* Luckily for us, our product owner is a fantastic UX designer, as well as our biggest advocate, so our docsite looks awesome. I can&#x27;t show you, but trust me.
* Your team may need to pull in outside resources to design documentation that is readable by humans. Spend some stakeholder interview time on this, too.

      ![a screenshot of accessibility documentation on the carbon design system site](/images/ds-carbon--docs.png)

[carbondesignsystem.com](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview)
Notes:* IBM&#x27;s Carbon Design System is my current developer crush, it&#x27;s something like a gold standard for react-based design systems.
* Carbon doesn&#x27;t have the flashiest docs site, but they do have tons and tons of written guidelines. 
* This documentation is expansive, covering all sorts of things such as, how to implement the system, onboarding for designers and developers, best practices for accessibility, content and more, and documentation about why decisions were made.

      # Adaptable
Notes:* On a design system team, some endeavors—even when thoughtfully approached—are guesswork– predicting potential brand updates, estimating upcoming component work, forecasting political decisions, or prioritizing pipeline changes. 
* Chances are, some of our guesses are going to be wrong. 
* What can we do to minimize the guesswork and make educated choices?

      ###### Be Adaptable <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Iterate as the need arises.
Notes:* For every major decision, our design system team interviews stakeholders to validate assumptions we make.
* This is especially important if your design system team is not directly implementing the designs, elements, and components in the product environment. 
* The goal is to make well-informed, educated guesses as often as possible. Sparkbox takes great pride in our skills at forecasting and estimating engagements, so it makes sense that when we are building design systems, we aim to correctly forecast our product teams&#x27; work.

## Iterate as the need arises.
Notes:* Recently, our design system has had to grow to support many more teams building brand new React Components. 
* We haven&#x27;t completely solved this problem, but we will have to stretch and reform the old system to meet the new needs.
* We get better with every iteration.

<blockquote>Individuals commit the sunk cost fallacy when they continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort) (Arkes & Blumer, 1985).</blockquote>

[behavioraleconomics.com](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/)
Notes:* The Sunk Cost fallacy is public enemy number one as a design system ages.
* We spend so much time and resources building and perfecting and documenting that when something isn&#x27;t working, we fight tooth and nail to keep it anyway. 
* Be aware of sunk cost and be willing to pivot away from things that no longer benefit your subscribers.

      ### Your system has to <br /> be willing to change and grow.
Notes:* My technical director loves to tell us to &quot;fail fast.&quot; 
* Recognize that &quot;fast&quot; for a design system can be months or longer. 
* Be attentive. Attempt to validate every assumption with the developers, designers, and content managers who actually use the system you are building, and iterate on the feedback you receive.

      # Branded
Notes:* Around Sparkbox, there&#x27;s an ongoing joke that a &quot;pattern library&quot; turns into a &quot;design system&quot; once you give it a name. 
* That might not be far from the truth.
* Our last adjective is also the most fun. Your system needs a brand.

## Name Your System
Notes:* When a design system has a name—a brand—it can become a real product. 
* Some of the best names are drawn from punny vernacular relevant to the product your team produces. They probably even start as jokes.
* Our ecom design system for clothing brands is named after a sewing term.
* Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign design system was named &quot;Pantsuit,&quot; after her staple outfit.

## Make It Official
Notes:* Once you have a name, the next step is to brand your domain.
* An official sounding domain, such as &quot;atlassian dot design&quot; or &quot;carbon design system dot com&quot; lends instant credibility to your design system. 
* Plus, branded domain names are way easier to remember and thus easier for subscribers to find and use.

[design.trello.com](https://design.trello.com/)
Notes:* Another of my favorite design system branding strategies is &quot;Nachos&quot; by Trello. 
* The whole system is fun and friendly, with the Trello mascot, Taco the Dog leading the way. 
* Plus, Nachos has some of the best design guidelines I&#x27;ve seen in a system. And I&#x27;ve looked at a LOT.
* Branding your design system is a key step toward marketing.

## Send Newsletters
Notes:* Consistent marketing of a design system—and its updates—helps keep subscribers engaged.
* One way our design system encourages the adoption of version updates is by creating a &quot;business case&quot; for every major or minor version.
* We send out email and messaging announcements with links to our release notes, a quick overview of what’s new and what’s changed, and an answer to the question, &quot;Why Should I Update?&quot; Writing a strong, persuasive answer to this question for every release has improved our subscriber buy-in quite a bit.

Notes:* I wanted to come back to Van Gogh here. 
* Van Gogh did not become famous many decades after his death in 1891, but rather only a few years. 
* Van Gogh&#x27;s works were largely inherited by his brother&#x27;s widow, Jo.
* Jo shopped his paintings to many exhibitions, loaning it to museums, and promoting the works at the ground level. 
* Additionally, in 1914, Jo published Van Gogh&#x27;s life story, along with a collection of letters written by him. 
* Funnily enough, sending newsletters worked for Van Gogh.
