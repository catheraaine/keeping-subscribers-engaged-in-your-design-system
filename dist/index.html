Van Gogh is an artist and nobody wants to buy his paintings. This is like design systems that we know are beautiful but no one wants to use. How do we do what Van Gogh couldn&#x27;t, and get people to buy our paintings, er, design system?

      # What is a Design System?
Notes:* Before we get to problems and solutions, let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re all on the same page with terminology.

## Design System
Notes:* So what is a design system?
* The origins of a design system started in print, with what any classically trained graphic designer or writer may know as a &quot;style guide.&quot;

Notes:* According to the 99 designs blog, &quot;A brand style guide is a document that codifies how an organization presents itself to the world. Put another way, it’s a reference tool that helps maintain consistency by demonstrating what a brand looks, feels and sounds like.&quot;
* I think you can translate that definition word-for-word to the web, but I&#x27;ve got some others for you, too.

Notes:* In 2018, Sparkbox put together a design systems survey in order to chip away at the ambiguity around one of our core technologies. 
* The survey states that, &quot;design systems are living codebases of frontend components that solve real-life problems for enterprise organizations, agencies and companies of all sizes.&quot;
* I&#x27;ll be referencing this more, but if you want to read the complete survey, it&#x27;s at design systems survey dot see sparkbox dot com

### Pattern Library <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
### Style Guide <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* A design system can be a architeture device that provides both brand expression and completed components,
* It can be a &#x27;pattern library&#x27; as a place to copy-and-paste common code snippets, 
* It can be a style guide, providing color palette, fonts, iconography, and animations, as well as tone and voice guidelines and so much more.
* Whatever a design system means to you and your team, eventually we all ask the question, “How do we encourage people to keep using our design system?”

## Subscriber
Notes:* Beyond &quot;design system&quot;, I say the word &quot;subscriber&quot; quite a bit. 
* In this case, a &quot;subscriber&quot; is someone who will implement the design system on a larger body of work.
* A subscriber can be a developer, designer, copy-writer, or product manager or owner.
* These sub-groups have different needs, and it may be worthwhile to identify which groups have a vested interest in each specific area of your system.

* Instead, let&#x27;s focus on the challenges of getting people to use the cool thing you&#x27;ve built.

Notes:* The design system I&#x27;ve been working on for nearly three years is not new. It was first thought of in 2015, and released to beta in early 2016. 
* We&#x27;ve gone through five major versions, that&#x27;s five releases of exciting new components and messy breaking changes. We&#x27;ve had huge successes, such as changing every instance of a major brand color and or the entire font profile of multiple brands almost at the flip of a switch.
* We&#x27;ve had huge failures, components that go unused or outdated, JavaScript that does nothing but sit in a repository, and a number of late night patch releases. 
* And still I end up asking myself this question on a regular basis.

      ![why do design systems fail?](/images/ds-survey-chart.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height:80vh" -->

[designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/)
Notes:* The Sparkbox design systems survey asked the question, why do you think your design system failed? 
* There were a lot of answers, from lack of executive champion to funding issues. In my mind, all of these answers boil down to one thing. 
* These failing systems were not considered products.

  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### The Answer: <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Your Design System <br /> = Your Product.
Notes:* In order to convince subscribers to use your design system, you must treat it like a product. 
* That&#x27;s it. From here on out, the rest should make sense. If we give our design systems the same attention we give any other product we build, it has a much higher chance of long-term success.

Notes:* Your design system is your Desirable, Funded, Teachable, Attentive, Documented, Branded, Adaptable Product.
* So let&#x27;s build a product that&#x27;s all that, then _maybe_ people will want to use it. No promises.

      ## Have an Ambassador
Notes:* If your design system team is separate from your product development team, attend the product team’s standups or feature-planning meetings.

      ## Hold Stakeholder Interviews
Notes:* Decide if a story will effect stakeholders in a meaningful way. If yes, schedule what we call a &quot;stakeholder interview.&quot; Who has a stake in the way this story plays out?
* Assign one person to run the interview. Often, this will include a demo and questions in advance. The rest of the contributing team should attend, but their is to observe, learn, and ask questions, not to have discussion or try to persuade the interviewee. 
* Spend as much time as possible on the stakeholders&#x27; thoughts, your time with them is limited.
* Ultimately your design system team will make a decision on your own, but this decision should be informed by the information gathered in the stakeholder interviews. The decision may simply be a confirmation of your path forward.

      ## Hubspot - Rotating Design System Team
"Your system should be owned by all."
[bit.ly/ds-hubspot]( http://bit.ly/ds-hubspot)
Notes:* Alternatively, I want to point out Hubspot&#x27;s rotating design system team.
* In this blog post, Hubspot explains their process for creating a design system team is to dedicate hours from product team members on a rotating, 6-month schedule. 
* The idea is that if the design system is owned by all, everyone has the opportunity to create something they&#x27;ll have to use.
* There is a ton of context that comes from rotating onto a team while spending time is a subscriber; team members have an intimate understanding of subscriber problems.
* If your organization can accomplish this, or something like it, I think that is a brilliant option.

Notes:* No matter how you accomplish it, the trust gained by creating something useful for subscribers is priceless for a design system.

* Nothing makes a team bump a version faster than finding out the solve to their current woes lies within the next release.
