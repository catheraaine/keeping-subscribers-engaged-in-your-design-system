Van Gogh is an artist and nobody wants to buy his paintings. This is like design systems that we know are beautiful but no one wants to use. How do we do what Van Gogh couldn&#x27;t, and get people to buy our paintings, er, design system?

      # What is a Design System?
Notes:* Before we get to problems and solutions, let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re all on the same page with terminology.

Notes:* According to the 99 designs blog, &quot;A brand style guide is a document that codifies how an organization presents itself to the world. Put another way, it’s a reference tool that helps maintain consistency by demonstrating what a brand looks, feels and sounds like.&quot;

Notes:* In 2018, Sparkbox put together a design systems survey in order to chip away at the ambiguity around one of our core technologies. 
* The survey states that, &quot;design systems are living codebases of frontend components that solve real-life problems for enterprise organizations, agencies and companies of all sizes.&quot;

### Pattern Library <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
### Style Guide <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* A design system can be a architeture device that provides both brand expression and completed components,
* It can be a &#x27;pattern library&#x27; as a place to copy-and-paste common code snippets, 
* It can be a style guide, providing color palette, fonts, iconography, and animations, as well as tone and voice guidelines and so much more.
* Whatever a design system means to you and your team, eventually we all ask the question, “How do we encourage people to keep using our design system?”

* But what if a gif can be more than a quick laugh?
* Gifs are awesome for showing nav functionality, transitions, hover effects, animations, and pretty much any visual aspect of your work.

* This is a native app that creates gifs you can host via GitHub just like an image.
* Direct uploads give you the full privacy of your repo, so you&#x27;re hopefully not violating any security policies!
* It does cost $5, or included if you have Setapp, and only works on MacOS.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* GoVideo is a Chrome Extension that lets a user record their screen, face, and voice all at once.
* I know not everyone is a fan of Chrome, Vidyard does have a native app I haven&#x27;t tested.
* Specifically, we used videos on an engagement where the main reviewer, me, was not dedicated to the project full-time.
* Because I was not available for standups, did not have a direct hand in building the site, and wasn’t familiar with the changes being reviewed, the dev needed to explain the changes clearly for every PR.
* GoVideo is one of my new favorite ways to start a code review, I’ve made you a video to prove just how helpful it can be.
* I keep meaning to re-record this, but people tell me awkwarness is endearing.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* Depending on the size of the PR, a walk-through video only adds 5-10 minutes total to our setup time, but can potentially save the 30-60 minutes it might take to explain your PR via Slack or email (or scheduling a Zoom meeting).
* Video walkthroughs are useful when pairing with developers who have different schedules, who are remote, or who are not as familiar with the engagement.

      ## More Feedback Feedback
- Offer an alternative. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Phone a friend. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Choose which hills to die on. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Keep the tone light. 😁 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* Offer an alternative. If you have constructive feedback, try offering an alternative solution. I like to provide links to examples if I can, too.
* Phone a friend. If you find there is a disagrement that has passed back and forth a few times, call in a third person to be a tiebreaker. Since you all have two reviewers, you are probably already doing this. Be willing to admit when you are wrong if needed. This can be uncomfortable, yes, but smart people who admit their mistakes get a ton of respect from me.
* Choose which hills to die on. If dangle commas are preferable, but they aren&#x27;t in the style guide, maybe let that one slide from time to time.
* Keep the tone light. Have fun! Keep things lighthearted with bad jokes, emoji, and gifs. There are way too many dancing superhero gifs on the internet to not include them in your review approvals.
