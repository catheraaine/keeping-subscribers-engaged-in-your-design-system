      # Attentive
    notes: |
      * An attentive design system is one that listens to what its subscribers are saying about it. 
      * This may sound similar to "desireable" or even "teachable," however, being an attentive design system means really absorbing the feedback you gather.

      ###### Be Attentive <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## Listen to your customer.

    notes: |
      * Provide a path for subscribers to submit feedback and ask questions. 
      * Our design system team set up a dedicated channel in Slack and Microsoft Teams, allowing constant contact with subscribers. 
      * We’ve also added a link to our documentation site that goes to a Google Form for those who wish to provide anonymous feedback.

    notes: |
      * Remember that pluralsight example? They have this bright orange "open an issue" button on every single page.
      * Full disclosure–Our subscribers rarely submit feedback via the form on our site, as they prefer to reach out personally via chat whenever they have questions.

    notes: |
      * Office hours and stakeholder interviews are awesome ways to encourage conversation throught the entire process.
      * It's important to listen, even if feedback is that a component is broken or doesn't work in helpful ways.
