      # Branded

    notes: |
      * Around Sparkbox, there's an ongoing joke that a "pattern library" turns into a "design system" once you give it a name. 
      * That might not be far from the truth.
      * Our last adjective is also the most fun. Your system needs a brand.

      ## Name Your System

    notes: |
      * When a design system has a name—a brand—it can become a real product. 
      * Some of the best names are drawn from punny vernacular relevant to the product your team produces. They probably even start as jokes.
      * Our ecom design system for clothing brands is named after a sewing term.
      * Hillary Clinton's campaign design system was named "Pantsuit," after her staple outfit.

    notes: |
      * Shopify's "Polaris" design system has some truly beautiful branding, named after the guiding north star.
      * The site uses purple and gold throughout, to continue the starry theme.

      ## Make It Official

    notes: |
      * Once you have a name, the next step is to brand your domain.
      * An official sounding domain, such as "atlassian dot design" or "carbon design system dot com" lends instant credibility to your design system. 
      * Plus, branded domain names are way easier to remember and thus easier for subscribers to find and use.

    notes: |
      * Another of my favorite design system branding strategies is "Nachos" by Trello. 
      * The whole system is fun and friendly, with the Trello mascot, Taco the Dog leading the way. 
      * Plus, Nachos has some of the best design guidelines I've seen in a system. And I've looked at a LOT.
      * Branding your design system is a key step toward marketing.

      ## Send Newsletters

    notes: |
      * Consistent marketing of a design system—and its updates—helps keep subscribers engaged.
      * One way our design system encourages the adoption of version updates is by creating a "business case" for every major or minor version.
      * We send out email and messaging announcements with links to our release notes, a quick overview of what’s new and what’s changed, and an answer to the question, "Why Should I Update?" Writing a strong, persuasive answer to this question for every release has improved our subscriber buy-in quite a bit.

    notes: |
      * I wanted to come back to Van Gogh here. 
      * Van Gogh did not become famous many decades after his death in 1891, but rather only a few years. 
      * Van Gogh's works were largely inherited by his brother's widow, Jo.
      * Jo shopped his paintings to many exhibitions, loaning it to museums, and promoting the works at the ground level. 
      * Additionally, in 1914, Jo published Van Gogh's life story, along with a collection of letters written by him. 
      * Funnily enough, sending newsletters worked for Van Gogh.
