      # Funded
    notes: |
      * If you want a team to take your design system seriously, try taking it seriously yourself.
      * Having a funded product with a committed product owner or development team will help users treat your design system as ‚Äúreal.‚Äù

      ## Funding ‚û° Deliverables

    notes: |
      * When an organization spends money, they expect to get something in return. A budget requires a design system team to produce deliverables on a regular schedule. 
      * These deliverables are most often going to be a subscriber shipping something built with design system content.

      ## Funding ‚û° Deliverables ‚û° Process

    notes: |
      * Identifying deliverables for your design system turns into deadlines for those deliverables. "I want new form components, but I need them for our summer rebuild."
      * Deadlines will often turn into project sprints and roadmaps. 
      * In other words, delevierables will establish process.

    notes: |
      * The Pluralsight design system does a really nice job of documenting their roadmap. They not only have links to their soon-to-be-built components, but there's an open link to their project board and repository.

      ## Where is the Money? üí∞ 
      
      * UX/Design <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
      * Research & Development <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
      * Tech Debt <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

    notes: |
      * Finding the budget to support even a part-time team of designers, developers, and project managers on your ‚Äúidea‚Äù of a system may seem difficult or even impossible at first. 
      * Look for funding in interesting places. 
      * UX and design have a potential vested interest, as design systems often create consistency throughout branded experiences. 
      * If your team has an R&D budget, that can be a great place to create ‚Äústartup‚Äù or "skunkworks" kinds of projects. 
      * If your team works under one of the many models that makes time for tech debt, perhaps your design system can be built alongside refactoring of duplicate components.

    notes: |
      * If there is truly no funding to be had, attempt to find people who have a personal stake in the success of a system to work on a proof of concept. However, as soon as you have a proof of concept, look for funding again.
      * Funded design systems succeed, because there is a dedicated team building and improving the system.
      * We all have side projects sitting alone in forgotten repositories. Don't let a design system become one.
