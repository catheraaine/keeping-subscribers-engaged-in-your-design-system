      # What is a Design System?
    notes: |
      * Before we get to problems and solutions, let's make sure we're all on the same page with terminology.
      * This is a bit I stole from "Folding Ideas" which is a great channel on Youtube if you enjoy long format video essays. So check that out maybe.

      ## Design System
    notes: |
      * So what is a design system?
      * The origins of a design system started in print, with what any classically trained graphic designer or writer may know as a "style guide."

      <blockquote>“A brand style guide is a document that codifies how an organization presents itself to the world. Put another way, it’s a reference tool that helps maintain consistency by demonstrating what a brand looks, feels and sounds like.”</blockquote>

      * According to the 99 designs blog, "A brand style guide is a document that codifies how an organization presents itself to the world. Put another way, it’s a reference tool that helps maintain consistency by demonstrating what a brand looks, feels and sounds like."
      * I think you can translate that definition word-for-word to the web, but I've got some others for you, too.

    notes: |
      * In 2018, Sparkbox put together a design systems survey in order to chip away at the ambiguity around one of our core technologies. 
      * The survey states that, "design systems are living codebases of frontend components that solve real-life problems for enterprise organizations, agencies and companies of all sizes."
      * I'll be referencing this more, but if you want to read the complete survey, it's at design systems survey dot see sparkbox dot com

      ## Design System
    notes: |
      * Well-thought design systems can provide live, interactive examples of often used components,
      * Assist the rapid build of new pages and applications, 
      * And ensure brand consistency and uniformity across multiple digital formats.

      ### Design System
      ### Pattern Library <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
      ### Style Guide <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

    notes: |
      * A design system can be a architeture device that provides both brand expression and completed components,
      * It can be a 'pattern library' as a place to copy-and-paste common code snippets, 
      * It can be a style guide, providing color palette, fonts, iconography, and animations, as well as tone and voice guidelines and so much more.
      * Whatever a design system means to you and your team, eventually we all ask the question, “How do we encourage people to keep using our design system?”

      ## Subscriber

    notes: |
      * Beyond "design system", I say the word "subscriber" quite a bit. 
      * In this case, a "subscriber" is someone who will implement the design system on a larger body of work.
      * A subscriber can be a developer, designer, copy-writer, or product manager or owner.
      * These sub-groups have different needs, and it may be worthwhile to identify which groups have a vested interest in each specific area of your system.
