      # Teachable
    notes: |
      * A successful design system team does not “pass off” the system as updates happen; rather, they support subscribers throughout the adoption process. 
      * That is, your design system should be teachable.

      ## Subscribers come first.

    notes: |
      * Subscriber needs, within reason, are always at the top of our priorities. 
      * Teaching people to use a design system takes time and effort. Education pays off, though, as knowledge of your design system becomes ingrained in your subscriber’s team culture.

      ### Office Hours

    notes: |
      * We try to be available to pair with the developers and designers using what we’ve built. 
      * Twice a week my current team will hold "office hours," where any subscriber can come hang out with us and ask questions about the system.
      * Be present in locations where pairing is easy, either online or in person.

    notes: |
      * Keeping good release notes is a great starting point for sharing information between teams.
      * My very smart coworker, Kasey, has an awesome blog post about writing good release notes, check that one out.

    notes: |
      * Atlassian's design system has a changelog on their main page written in easy to understand, human terms. I'm a fan.

      ### Internal Workshops <br /> & Lunch 'n Learns

    notes: |
      * When your system has a new feature, present it! 
      * Every single week my team has a learning session called "UI Guild" across all product teams. Our team tries to share whenever we have something new.

      ### Virtual Learning Library

    notes: | 
      * One of the newest efforts our team has been working on is a "virtual learning library," which is a repository of recorded knowledge 
      * Whenever we teach or demo something, while in meetings, or pairing, or whatever, we record it and add the link to a common repository. 
      * This way, people can teach themselves on their own, as needed. Information is no longer bottlenecked by a single person.
      * Our Library lives in our wiki, and there's a link in every chat channel.

      ## Subscribers come first.

    notes: |
      * All of these things make using a design system easier by limiting the roadblocks of learning.
      * Eventually product teams can teach one another without much intervention.
