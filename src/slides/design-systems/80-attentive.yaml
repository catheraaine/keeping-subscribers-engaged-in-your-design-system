      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer
      ## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
      ##### tiny.cc/foundry-braun

    notes: |
      * A coworker of mine, Bryan, whom you know, wrote an article about this topic.
      * The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

      <blockquote>“Giving positive feedback is an easy habit to adopt. You're already reading through the lines of code, looking for issues. It doesn't take much time to throw in a ‘Nice!’ or ‘Looks great!’ If you see something awesome, say it!”<br /> - Bryan Braun</blockquote>

      * This is really difficult for me. My Meyers-Briggs type is a INTJ. Famous INTJs are such lovable characters, like Minecroft from Sherlock, Walter White from Breaking Bad, and Littlefinger from Game of Thrones. We're not nice by default. We can be a little direct.
      * Sometimes positive feedback feels fake, but that's okay. It won't read that way.
      * I really like leading zeros on decimal points in CSS. In any language, I enjoy descriptive comments. I am always complimenting these things, and it may feel forced, but it is honest.
      * A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.
