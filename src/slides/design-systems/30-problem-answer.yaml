      * A story should include the requirements of the work and a potential solution (if you have one in mind).
      * A story or issue doesnâ€™t need to be overly complicated, but should be easy to understand.
      * A well-written story makes for clear requirements when it comes time to PR.
      * This leads you to my first tool recomendation, and the only one that BitBucket doesn't yet have.
