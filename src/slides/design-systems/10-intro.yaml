      * I wanted to start today by telling you the story of Vincent Van Gogh. Van Gogh is a famous Dutch painter, some people even say the best of all time, next to Rembrandt. 
      * During his most prolific decade, Van Gogh painted almost 900 works, icluding landscapes, self-portraits, sunflowers, and more.
      * His "Starry Night" painting is available as phone cases, cross-stitch patterns, and cosmetic items in video games like "Apex Legends." There are movies, books, and tv shows about him, including my all time favorite episode of "Doctor Who."

      * Van Gogh's life, however, was a terribly sad story with a tragic ending. While alive, he sold only a single painting, and that was to a family member. 
      * Lots of jobs, like me
      * Maybe cut off his own ear. Maybe Paul Gauguin did it.
      How is it posisble that one man with such a brilliant body of work was unable to make a living doing it?
      *  Like Van Gogh's works, many design systems are objectively well-made, useful, and even beautiful. Also like Van Gogh's works, design systems can be hard to get people to buy into. 
      * So how do we as content creators do what Van Gogh couldn't, and get people to buy our paintings, er, design system?

      * I'm Catherine, I'm a full-stack developer (whatever that means).
      * I work at Sparkbox, a web design and development consultant in Dayton, Ohio.
      * That's me on Twitter
      * I use she/her pronouns.
      * I spent most of my last couple years building a single enterprise-level design system that supports a number of ecommerce sites built in a multitude of JavaScript frameworks, the largest of which is React.
      * Also, though I've prepared a good 50 minutes of content for you, I talk fast when I'm nervous. I never hit that mark.
